Hi.

If you somehow managed to get here, that neans that you saw the link to a project I did called "Giftstar" on my portfolio site. You're probably also wondering what the heck you're doing here on a blog instead of any type of web app.

Here's the thing: It's offline...for now.

Giftstar was, in essence, my bootcamp "capstone" project. It was a full stack project that I largely did by myself with a small bit of outside help (one person who worked on authentication and another who did absolutely nothing of value). Yes, I'm aware that a full stack app produced by bootcampers isn't super great, but it was meant to be a start towards something that, in my mind, would have real life uses.

As part of the bootcamp, we were told about Heroku, and its features (plus my lack of knowledge of other alternatives) made it seem like the perfect place to deploy the project. In 2022, however, Heroku decided to do away with their free tier and asked everyone to upgrade to a paid tier. This was controversial at the time for many reasons; among them was the fact that Heroku was one of the few hosting options that could support both a frontend website and backend server together. I felt that there was no real need to pay for Heroku; however, when I went to try and bring the project back in hopes of updating it, I found that EVERYTHING HAD BEEN WIPED. Personally, I had been meaning to do a rework of the application anyway, so I'm not too heartbroken over it (besides, the code is still up).

So that answers the question of what happened to Giftstar the project. However, that still doesn't answer the question of "Why are you here?"

Well...my hope was that the website you came from would not have to be relevant - or at least, by the time it was, my rework of the project would be ready to release. Sadly, in case you couldn't tell, that didn't happen. 

Long story short: App is currently down and I'm working on bringing it back as a new version. However, since my portfolio site may receive traffic now, this is my stopgap measure so that I don't link to a generic Heroku 404 error.
