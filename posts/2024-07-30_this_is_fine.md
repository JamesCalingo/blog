Today, we’re going to dive into the tech industry.

By now, you probably don't need me - a so-called "software developer" who's seemingly on the verge of a second career change in less than six years - to tell you things aren't so hot right now. You've probably seen the headlines of how tech companies are laying off people left and right - I can't even begin to list off the companies that had layoffs in the past few years. Meanwhile, companies like Alphabet (Google and YouTube), Meta (Facebook and Instagram), Microsoft, and Amazon are still raking in money - which makes it a little weird that they're saying stuff like this:

So tonight, let's take a look at how the tech industry has been faring for the last few years - how it got so big, why there's so much chaos now, and what the future may look like ()

## That O'Jays song ruined by one of Mark Burnett's business partners

Let's start with why tech jobs were so popular anyway, and you can probably guess the main reason:

(salary image)

That is quite a lot of money. However, it gets even more impressive when you consider this:

Now, there are two ways to look at this data. One is that . The other is that these are widely considered some of the most expensive places to live in the United States, so even if you're making "bank", you're still living in some weirdo's closet in the woods eating day old cup noodles.

However, there's another reason tech jobs are so popular: because all you really need is a computer to do your job, you could feasibly do it from anywhere. The pandemic, of course, exposed us to the possiblities of remote work, but the tech industry knew about them well before then.

However, said pandemic also exposed an uglier truth: CEOs don't like not having control over employees. 

## Prehistory

Now before we continue, I need to make one quick note: this is not the first time this has happened.

Around the turn of the millennium, there was a massive market crash in tech which became known as the "dot-com burst". What 

Of course, these types of things happen.

## Gotta go back, back to the past

The first coding bootcamps sprang up somewhere around 2011. There was a shortage of talent in the tech industry, and bootcamps sprang up as a way to fill that gap. The concept was simple: teach people the skills needed to fill the gaps in the market, watch them get hired into the industry and fill the gaps, and everyone wins! 

Many coding bootcamps angled themselves as a way for just about anyone to get into the industry. For a fraction of the cost of a college degree (both in terms of money and time), you would gain the skills needed to become a successful software developer or data scientist (among other things; these were the main options at the coding bootcamp I went to).

Websites that host reviews and advice for those considering a coding bootcamp used to publish annual “state of the market” reports. These were largely puff pieces that stated that bootcamps were doing better than ever, more students were enrolling in bootcamps year after year, jobs were bountiful for graduates, and that you’re considering a bootcamp, FLICKING DO IT. 

It’s been a few years since I’ve last seen a report on bootcamps like this, and there’s several potential reasons I think that is, but I don’t think we need to wait for someone to release “State of the Bootcamp 2024” - it already exists:

(This is fine image).

To put it lightly, things have gone so far south for the bootcamp industry that it feels like we’re almost about to come back around the other side of Antarctica - all we have to do is jump into the frigid waters of the Antarctic Ocean and hope the hypothermia doesn't get us before we meet the penguins.

By one expert’s estimation, at least eight coding bootcamps have shut down, restructured, or gone on hiatus since late 2023, while many others have had layoffs. One bootcamp put out this statement:

*“(R)ecent trends present a more complex challenge. The influx of new bootcamp programs, coupled with an increase in experienced developers seeking new opportunities due to layoffs and hiring freezes, has created a saturated market. Hiring managers are becoming more discerning, and unfortunately, some have developed negative experiences with bootcamp graduates from other programs, which impacts how they view all bootcamp graduates, regardless of program quality.”*

There's a few things there to break down.

### They're not half bad...they're ALL bad!

There's something that, for my money, isn't 

At the same time, college students, seeing how they could turn their college degree into a six-figure salary within three years, began turning to Computer Science en masse. Between this mass influx 

Many would argue that the "saturated market" mentioned in the quote above happened well before 2023 (at least at entry level). Once you got past that, however, the belief was that things

For many experienced developers, that has not been the case for a while, and there's a lot of reasons why.

## Everyone is hit

For example, let's look back at the Silicon Valley Bank saga.

Silicon Valley Bank (or SVB since abbreviations are the future apparently) is, as you may have guessed from its name, a bank based in Silicon Valley (i.e. the part of California where a lot of the big tech companies like to "hang out").

In 2023, companies were being told by their financial advisors that capital was about to run tight, so liquid assets (i.e. real cash in hand) was going to be important.

Outside of all of THAT, there's other things going on in Tech that have put the squeeze on bootcamps.

## “We’re not talking about the game, we’re talking about PRACTICE.”
I know a lot of people have a lot of opinions about Allen Iverson, but the thing you gotta realize is that he’s still one of the game’s all time greats. He literally dragged a team on his back to the NBA Finals, was a multiple time All Star Game MVP, and was one of the most dynamic players at the turn of the millennium.

…wait, that’s the wrong AI. Sorry about that.

Anyway, artificial intelligence has become a massive talking point. Probably one of the best known controversies involving THIS AI has been in the arts, where lazy CEOs have tried using it all over the place because they think paying artists and actors sub-minimum wage is STILL too much apparently.

## Made in...somewhere

I am a collector of baseball hats. In the past, the company that makes the hats for Major League Baseball made all of their hats - the ones that the players wore and the ones sold to the fans - were made in a factory in the United States (Buffalo, NY to be more specific).

I don't remember when exactly it happened, but the company announced that production of many of the hats would be moving overseas. This outraged other collectors similar to myself, and when we got the "new" hats, we found out that they were, as expected, not as good as the old ones (case in point: you can have two hats of the same size and they wouln't fit consistently).

I mentioned the rise of remote work as a pandemic era , and from the looks of things, American CEOs have taken two sides on it: they either hate it and wish they could have all their , or they've leaned heavily into remote - in a different way than you'd expect.

A number of American tech companies have chosen to at least partially move their software departments overseas, and while it hasn't been 100% "great", a number of companies have found ways to make it work. There are a number of reasons for companies to (try to) outsource their software teams, but easily the biggest one is money.

Think back to that distribution of software jobs and salaries. Many software jobs in the U.S. are concentrated in some of the most expensive 

For example, one of the "most popular" countries for software outsourcing is India, where for a lot of people, even the lowest of U.S. salaries is a MASSIVE boon for them. 

The first company I worked for in tech more or less did this; I was in the 

## The impact

So 

As mentioned earlier, there was already concer about the entry level market even BEFORE everything started spiraling downward.

Take, for example, this LinkedIn post from 2021:

*"This morning, I woke up to another rejection letter. Just in time for Christmas. I am grateful for what I have and I work for a great company, but I am still not working as a software developer.*

*I’ve been looking, applying, and interviewing for 867 days. I was laid off from my job of 10 years in 2016 and learning how to code gave me hope for the future. I already had a Graduate degree in another field. I’ve slowly been losing hope.*

*I am currently in worse shape than I was in 2016, before I was laid off. I have overwhelming school and bootcamp tuition that I can’t afford to pay. My credit score tanked and I have lived with my sister for 1 1/2 years.*

*At what point do you cut your losses and realize that there isn’t an entry level developer job out there for (age and gender redacted)?"*

This was something I saw on LinkedIn one day. This person had 

There are two ways to look at what this is doing to 

**1. More stressful job hunting.**

The 

**2. Alleged pay cuts (keyword: alleged)**

They say that in order to make more as a developer, you have to job hop. 

There's tons of stories out there of people who left a job for one reason or another, tried to find another one, but had to settle for being paid LESS than their old job.
