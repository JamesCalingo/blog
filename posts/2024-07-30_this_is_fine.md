Today, we’re going to dive into the tech industry.

By now, you probably don't need me, a so-called "software developer" who's seemingly on the verge of needing to career change for the second time in less than six years, to tell you things aren't so hot right now. However, I think it's important to take a closer look at how this is impacting people (again, see my description of myself).

On the surface, you see that jobs are scarce, positions are getting more applicants than they can handle, and the topic I'd like to shine a lens on: the fact that the entry level market is getting brutalized by people with two or more years of professional experience (keyword is more).

Computer Science has become one of the most popular majors in colleges recently, with tech careers being viewed as a easy way to get rich quick. However, many students nowadays are 

However, there's another group of folks who 

Coding Bootcamp students. 

## The bootcamp market

Coding bootcamps angled themselves as a way for just about anyone to get into the industry. For a fraction of the cost of a college degree (both in terms of money and time), you would gain the skills needed to become a successful software developer or data scientist (among other things; these were the main options at the coding bootcamp I went to).

From what I've read/can remember, the "coding bootcamp" concept was born sometime in the early 2010s out of a lack of available workers in tech; companies needed to find people to 

Websites that host reviews and advice for those considering a coding bootcamp used to publish annual “state of the market” reports. These were largely puff pieces that stated that bootcamps were doing better than ever, more students were enrolling in bootcamps year after year, jobs were bountiful for graduates, and that you’re considering a bootcamp, FLICKING DO IT. 

It’s been a few years since I’ve last seen a report on bootcamps like this, and there’s several potential reasons I think that is, but I don’t think we need to wait for someone to release “State of the Bootcamp 2024” - it already exists:

(This is fine image).

To put it lightly, things have gone so far south for the bootcamp industry that it feels like we’re almost about to come back around the other side of Antarctica - all we have to do is jump into the frigid waters of the Antarctic Ocean and hope the hypothermia doesn't get us before we meet the penguins.

By one expert’s estimation, at least eight coding bootcamps have shut down, restructured, or gone on hiatus, while many others have had layoffs. One bootcamp put out this statement:

“However, recent trends present a more complex challenge. The influx of new bootcamp programs, coupled with an increase in experienced developers seeking new opportunities due to layoffs and hiring freezes, has created a saturated market. Hiring managers are becoming more discerning, and unfortunately, some have developed negative experiences with bootcamp graduates from other programs, which impacts how they view all bootcamp graduates, regardless of program quality.”

There's a few things there to break down.

## They're not half bad...they're ALL bad!

The old saying goes that a few rotten apples spoil the bunch.

## SVB, VC, and CVF

Silicon Valley Bank is, as you may have guessed from its name, a bank based in Silicon Valley (i.e. the part of California where a lot of the big tech companies like to "hang out").

In 2023, companies were being told by their financial advisors that capital was about to run tight, so liquid assets (i.e. real cash in hand) was going to be important.

Outside of all of THAT, there's other things going on in Tech that have put the squeeze on bootcamps.

## “We’re not talking about the game, we’re talking about PRACTICE.”
I know a lot of people have a lot of opinions about Allen Iverson, but the thing you gotta realize is that he’s still one of the game’s all time greats. He literally dragged a team on his back to the NBA Finals, was a multiple time All Star Game MVP, and was one of the most dynamic players at the turn of the millennium.

…wait, that’s the wrong AI. Sorry about that.

Anyway, artificial intelligence has become a massive talking point. Probably one of the best known controversies involving THIS AI has been in the arts, where lazy CEOs have tried using it all over the place because they think paying artists and actors sub-minimum wage is STILL too much apparently.

## Made in...somewhere

I am a collector of baseball hats. In the past, the company that makes the hats for Major League Baseball made all of their hats - the ones that the players wore and the ones sold to the fans - were made in a factory in the United States (Buffalo, NY to be more specific).

I don't remember when exactly it happened, but the company announced that production of many of the hats would be moving overseas. This outraged other collectors similar to myself, and we found ourselves when the hats we were getting were, as expected, not as good as the old ones. 

Tech companies have done the same with their software teams, and while it hasn't been 100% "great", a number of companies have found ways to make it work. There are a number of reasons 

The first company I worked for in tech more or less did this; I was in the
