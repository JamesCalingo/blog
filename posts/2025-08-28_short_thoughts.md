I had a bit of an epiphany last night when discussing <a href="http://sportventures.netlify.app" target="blank">my sports blog</a> with friends:

“Your blog is just thoughts put into words.”

In one way, it should be obvious. Part of the reason I titled this blog “Overclocked Overthoughts” is that second word (not necessarily the “over” part, more the “thoughts”), yet somehow, this is a thing that I never truly came to realize.

And I think I’ve let that hold me back for too long.

Writing these posts is not easy. I often cringe at my lack of varied sentence structure, double think if what I’m posting should be said or if its too controversial, write things out of order (start with the beginning, go to the end, and then fill in the middle) and question if any of this writing is actually any good in the first place. In the end, it’s because of those things that I often end up starting posts, losing steam midway through, and then scrapping said posts (so maybe “overthoughts” isn’t a misnomer after all).

However, at some point, they have to be “final”. Sure, I could always sneak some edits in here and there, but that would be somewhat disingenuous. I need to learn to let go of the “nitpicky” editor in me and just accept my writings for what they are: a characterization of my thoughts - ready or not. I feel like if I can do that, then this blog will be able to be what I wanted it to be: a place to share myself with others, and see where that can take me.

And for those who don't know: "Overclocking" is when you try to run a computer beyond its manufacturer specified standards. It doesn't really pertain to this blog or its content as I'm not a big PC gamer, but I was a fan of the alliteration (and because "Clocked Thoughts" is NOT the same).
