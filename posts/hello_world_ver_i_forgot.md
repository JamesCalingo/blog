Hello!

Welcome to James Calingo’s blog version x.0!

I’ve tried having SEVERAL blogs in the past, and while I had varying amounts of “success” with them, they all kinda fell by the wayside.

So what makes this one different from them?

While I can’t guarantee that there will be consistently be content here, I can safely say that this one represents a major shift from the other blogs I’ve had.

Why? Because I built it 100% from scratch.

To give some context as to why that’s important for me, let me delve a bit into my blogging history.

My first blog was on tumblr WAY back in the day. For those of you who are too young to remember tumblr, it was a popular site in the late 2000s where people made “blogs” about things. I use quotations there because while tumblr was technically a blogging site, content was mainly just “someone makes a popular post and then everyone just reblogs it” (think modern day Twitter without the character limit). Technically, tumblr IS still around, but unless I’m mistaken it’s WAY less popular these days (partly due to a change in their content policy involving…the art people usually posted).

Then, I moved on to WordPress, using that for several years through college and then a few years after that. When I started learning how to code, however, I realized that if I was to become a developer, then it might be a good idea to move away from WordPress and move towards something else. Yes, I know WordPress is still widely used, but I feel like I have a lot more control over my blog this way.

My last blog, which features a grand total of twelve posts, was the first time I had tried making my own blog using my own coding skills.

Here’s the thing, though: it was essentially a copy of something else. I found it when trying to find a “tutorial” for making a blog, and while it was nice having more control over the whole thing, I’ve always wanted to try building the entire thing on my own.

…And that’s where this site comes in. It’s something I’ve built from the ground up.

Mostly.

This blog is largely based on [this tutorial I found online](https://www.kalopilato.com/blog/how-to-build-and-deploy-your-personal-blog-with-next-js). Unlike the last version, however, this one involved me writing all of the code myself (minus copying a few RegEx things).

If you’re reading this on the day it comes out, odds are that things here look a little…rough. That’s largely because I finished a lot of the HTML/JS last Friday and was kinda busy this past weekend, so I haven’t really had time to get into the “nitty gritty” of CSSing this thing. That will come soon, however, and hopefully it'll be good (unlike a lot of people, I actually kinda like doing my own CSS)

If you’re wondering about when I’ll be updating this, I don’t think giving a hard answer is really that great of an idea. My HOPE is at least once a week, but we’ll see how much I can keep that up.

That's enough for now I feel. Talk to you soon!
