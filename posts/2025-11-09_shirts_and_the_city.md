_I was originally going to post this to my <a href="https://sportventures.netlify.app" target="blank">sports blog</a> as a bit of a "special feature", but ended up deciding to move it here. Consider it a bit of a "cross-post", if you will, and be sure to check out my sports blog, as that seems to be the one I update WAY more often..._

If you’re of a certain age, you may be a fan of vintage or thrift store shopping. It’s become a massive trend amongst the younger generations for various reasons (at least I think it has), and thrift/vintage stores are quite popular on social media.

Personally, I’ve had my fair share of thrift store trips for one simple reason: it’s one of the more interesting ways of sourcing jerseys. Y’see, modern jerseys are often highly overpriced; for example, hockey and baseball (i.e. the two I’ve collected the most) START around $200, but the super nice ones (i.e. the only ones worth getting for me) are typically >$400. However, at thrift stores, you can find jerseys for a much lower price; sure, most of the jerseys you find at thrift stores are random schools, very clearly fake, or those old NFL/NBA jerseys with ironed on lettering that is peeling like crazy, but every once in a while, you’ll come across an absolute GEM (for example: I once found a GAME WORN JERSEY for less than what most retail jerseys cost nowadays).

This post, however, is going to focus on one specific sport: soccer. I’m here to talk about soccer jerseys (or, as I will be calling them going forward, “football shirts”), as I’ve been using them as workout shirts for when I go for walks or to play pickleball with friends since I’ve found that they’re good for these purposes (plus they turn heads).

Personally, inasmuch as I could just stick to the easy to find clubs at American stores (and I kinda have at times)...it’s not always the most interesting thing to me. Yes, I do have some of the bigger clubs like Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur, and Newcastle United (I have somewhat of an affinity for them because they play at a place named St James’ Park[^1]), and there are some shirts that I’m interested in (like that green Liverpool shirt they just came out with), but I’d absolutely love to rock something like AFC Bournemouth, Crystal Palace, or Fulham - teams whose shirts I have NEVER seen in the United States (before this trip[^2]). At vintage stores...you're going to find a lot of the same sadly. HOWEVER...you can occasionally find a gem, and there are certain stores in New York City that specialize in vintage football shirts, so that's what I'd like to discuss in this post[^3].

New York City features a TON of vintage stores (many of which I have perused in the past), but there are TWO stores that are going to be featured in this post that specialize in vintage football shirts. I visited them both on November 8, 2025, as I had plans later that day in Brooklyn, but decided to head into New York City early so I could check these stores out.

The first store I went to, aptly enough, is named "Classic Football Shirts". They're an "import" from the United Kingdom, and have been featured somewhat extensively on YouTube via a video series in which soccer/football content creators search for shirts in their stores. They have locations in Los Angeles, Miami, and obviously New York (plus locations in the UK that I'm not going to get into as I don't know when I'll be able to get over there - though I'd like to sometime).

The other one is a place called "Saturdays Football" (which is kinda sorta also fitting as this trip occurred on a Saturday). From what I can tell, it's an American operation with three locations: one each in the three largest cities in the United States (Chicago, Los Angeles, and, of course, New York).

My original intention was to discuss each of these stores separately; however, they ended up being rather similar: both have some "store brand" items, a collection of current jerseys/shirts, and of course...a TON of vintage shirts. One BIG difference, however: Classic Football Shirts had sizes on the hangars, which IMO gives it a slight edge in customer experience.

I was hoping to have more time than I did for each store - my original plan was to arrive at 11 AM when Classic Football Shirts opened, browse that store for a while, and then go to Saturdays when it opened at noon (conveniently, it's only a few blocks away); I likely would have had a good 30-45 minutes at each store, which I felt would be plenty of time to peruse and make decisions. However, my train into New York got delayed for almost an hour, so I ended up arriving at like 11:45 and had much less time than I wanted. This ended up being kinda important, as the MASSIVE selection of teams ended up being kinda overwhelming, and I didn't have the time to go through all the shirts, so I decided to focus on England (which is the non-American country I tend to follow the most) and Germany (a country I like to try to follow[^4]).

I ended up going with...

- **From Classic Football Shirts: <a href="https://www.footballkitarchive.com/sunderland-afc-2007-08-home-kit/11219/" target="blank">This Sunderland shirt from 2007</a>**[^5]<br>
  The feel good story of the Premier League as of this being posted, Sunderland have been punching well above their weight in their first Premier League season since 20. In fact, the day I bought this, Sunderland played a big game against league leading Arsenal and pulled out an exciting 2-2 draw. It's also apt that the link above includes a Dwight Yorke shirt as its example, as his name and number are on the shirt I got too!<br>
  I also thought about getting a Borussia Monchengladbach shirt here, but I ended up deciding against it because I didn't like how the manufacturer (Puma) did the badge (it has rubber letters on it which aren't sewn on).

- **From Saturdays Football: <a href="https://www.footballkitarchive.com/blackburn-rovers-2006-07-home-kit/12261/" target="blank">This Blackburn Rovers shirt from 2006</a>**<br>
  With how things have been going for Blackburn recently, it can be easy to forget that they're one of two non-Big Six teams to have won the Premier League (back in 1995). They're currently (11/9/25) languishing near the bottom of England's second division, though they JUST missed out on the chance to return to the Premier League that Sunderland ended up getting last season. While the contrasting half-and-half design is cool, the front has "pits" which are the same colors as the sleeves, and it makes this one look a bit awkward...<br>
  I also thought about getting an Everton shirt here, but I didn't like how it rose up too high when I lifted my arms (a "modern Umbro" problem I had seen before with a West Ham United shirt one time).

There are, of course, A TON MORE vintage stores - and that’s just if you’re talking about New York City! Like I said earlier, I didn’t have enough time to explore more (outside of a short visit to a nearby store that didn't have anything I was interested in), but maybe in the future…

Also, Sunderland's impressive draw prompted me to <a href="https://sportventures.netlify.app/2025-11-09_brooklynfc_womens" target="blank">wear it to a football match later that day...</a>

[^1]: Though the whole PIF thing does make things complicated…
[^2]: Sadly, I did not see either Bournemouth or Crystal Palace shirts at the stores I went to...did see quite a few Fulham shirts though.
[^3]: I was originally thinking of visiting a third soccer specific store in Times Square, but nixed it for...multiple reasons. One of them being Times Square.
[^4]: One of my closest friends is a massive Bayern Munich fan, so I probably should not mention things I've gotten from the Puma store at Jersey Gardens...despite the rubber letters.
[^5]: I realize that saying I have an affinity for Newcastle United and then buying a Sunderland shirt would likely get me in trouble should I ever visit North East England...
