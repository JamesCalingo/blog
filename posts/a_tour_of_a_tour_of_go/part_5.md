## Generics

This section is super short - in fact, there are only two modules in it!

However, it goes over something that is often not thought about if you're working in Python or JavaScript and fairly important to Go and other statically typed languages (i.e. TypeScript): generics.

You'll often see <T> or something of the sort when reading about types in statically typed languages such as TypeScript or Go. This generally means that 

### Type parameters

Type parameters allow functions to work on multiple types. 

### Generic types

Types have the ability to be "genericized" as well.

Seemingly not Up next: the final section of this tour, and one that's rather important.
