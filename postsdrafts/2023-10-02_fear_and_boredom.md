One thing that sucks about job searching: You're never really sure what to do.

When working, a set of tasks that had to be done was always in front of me. This was handy in helping me organize my work, especially at the beginning when I was still trying to figure out the codebase/technologies I was using.

However, those tasks slowly started becoming far less challenging, and 

Now, I'm trying to figure out who to talk to

I do have more resources this time than my last job search, I feel, but using them has still been a struggle. For example, I met someone who works in HR at a fairly big company with a nearby office (I'm not going to name it, but it's pretty well known in the "tech space" I think). She told me that if I found any jobs I was interested in to let her know. I went to her company's website, and for my field, there were only two types of jobs - internships and senior level (3-5+ years experience). Sadly, at about 1.5 years experience, I'm overqualified for the internships and underqualified for the senior jobs.
