I think I'm finally ready to discuss what happened at my first job. Enough time has passed since I left where I don't think some of the things that may have been less 

I actually didn't even apply for it - the company reached out to me on LinkedIn, I did a few interviews, and ended up with the job.

Originally, there was one member of my team (essentially my supervisor) who was in office; the rest were overseas (not just remote: actually in another continent entirely). However, less than a month into my tenure, I overheard my supervisor having rather heated discussions with the CEO and his father (our owner and senior advisor); the following Monday, I came in to find that he had left.

For the rest of my time with the company, I was the only one in my department in the office; there were other hires in my department, but they were also overseas.  In theory, this isn’t necessarily a bad thing; after all, other companies have teams that are completely remote. The issue here was that, again, this was my first job in tech; there was no in-office support if I got stuck on things (which, of course, happened fairly often). The senior dev I worked with was pretty good about answering my questions, however - even if he didn’t completely seem to understand what was going on at times (due to the physical disconnect).

As time wore on, I found myself getting stuck less and less - or, at least, I found that I could figure my way out of things given enough time. I also found that I was able to get things done more quickly - instead of certain tasks needing multiple weeks to be finished, I could get them done in one. However, my tasks were not really scaling up to match; I was still doing a lot of the same things over and over again, and it eventually grew quite boring.

In addition, getting code out was not the only part of my job. There were multiple projects involving hardware that, in theory, should have been 100% handled by the devs working on the software they were to be paired with. However, since said devs were in two separate continents, and shipping the required peripherals to them was more trouble than it was worth (especially with one jumping from country to country every month), I was put in charge of these projects. Now, I’m not going to sit here and say that a junior developer shouldn’t be in charge of any projects - I had no reference point at the time - but these peripherals had nothing to do with the work I was coding (mobile applications), so I had to split my time and energy between my actual work and these projects.

I did what I could to get these projects going - learning how the peripherals actually worked, making sure that the people who needed to be pinged got pinged, etc.. However, things eventually stalled on them, and while I was busy working on the actual coding I was hired for, customers were growing ever more antsy about when these peripherals would be available...but I was never informed of this. I had just assumed that since I hadn’t heard anything about the projects, we would be able to reopen them at a later time.

Clearly, that was the wrong way to do things, because two weeks before I left, I was asked about the status of these projects by one of my bosses and found out that they were MONTHS overdue; I was also asked where the iPad I was using to test these products was. I had an iPad I bought from a used electronics store to test things, but that day, I forgot said iPad in my car but was unaware of that since my car was pretty messy at the time, so I said that I didn’t know where the iPad was.

That, boys, girls, and thems, was (very probably) the dagger. In admitting I had no idea where my iPad was, I created a potential liability: had my iPad been truly lost/stolen, then it could end up in the hands of a competitor (who dominates the industry the company works in but is pretty controversial). Development versions of apps were on that iPad (which, due to the nature of the apps, were permanently signed in), so if they were cunning enough to find a way in, they would have free access to competition secrets - and how to take advantage of that (or at least, that's what I was told).

In addition, things were about to move SUPER fast - sales was adding customers left and right, and the CEO was creating partnerships with other companies that ended up creating tasks that would eventually require the full attention of the team members I worked most closely with. I felt that conditions at the company were quickly coming to a point where, because of how things were being handled. I would either plateau since I was still working on the same projects or that I would end up in a sink or swim situation with dire consequences if I messed up (which had kinda sorta already happened).

Either way, I felt that I was no longer in a situation that was suitable for my long term career growth. The only thing keeping me from moving on, I felt, would be the job market; I was at the 18-month mark, and while that's historically a good place to start moving on, big tech layoffs and company downsizings meant that my level of experience - formerly enough to earn some interest - was (probably) too little to garner much attention anymore. 

However, on a Thursday morning BEFORE work hours, I was called into the office to be informed that I was being let go - something I didn't realize the strangeness of until it was pointed out to me the week after. Economics were not cited as a reason for my departure, but I felt that they did play a part in it, and here's where things get super speculative.

Remember how I mentioned sales adding tons of customers? Well, there were only three or four people who would be able to set those customers up with the system; two had left in the months prior. 

In addition, the company's growth strategy was by establishing partnerships with other companies. While this helped keep the company small and allowed it to focus on other things they deemed important, said partnerships were built on high levels of trust - and I saw at least one partnership be made and then go sour in half a year. 

Thus, I'd wager that my departure is less about me and my still developing skillset and more about a strategic pivot for the company; either because they feel that customer support is a much more pressing need and/or because they're worried about cashflow.

There were a few other things that made the departure a bit less harsh:

- I was new-ish to Boston and wanted to try and make friends in the area; however, my office was way out in the suburbs (it was approximately midway between Boston and Cape Cod), so doing things like meeting friends for dinner was never going to happen thanks to Boston traffic. Originally, I was to be in office five days a week for 90 days and then go hybrid from there; however, that never really happened (though I did have one day a week from home for the final few months). Part of that was my supervisor leaving and me not being sure who to ask about that system, which actually leads to another major issue:
- I had no idea who I was reporting to for most of the time. I THINK it was supposed to be the CTO, but he was in Europe and technically a contractor, so I ended up “reporting” to the top level management in the office (this is part of the structural issues that created my situation).
- One of the main “perks” of this job was that, as it was a restaurant POS system based in an actual restaurant, we were given free lunches. This is nice and all, but when you eat from the same cooks every single day, you realize whether or not they’re consistent with the food, and you can probably guess where this is going…
- I only ever received one bonus: it was on Christmas, and it was $200 (and taxed, too!)

Overall, I think that this was a good first experience as a developer. Obviously there were some issues, but it helped me realize what being a developer truly is, and it even helped me understand important concepts that I had been using without fully understanding them (i.e. things you learn in bootcamp and then use repeatedly because you know how to make them work without truly understanding the why).
