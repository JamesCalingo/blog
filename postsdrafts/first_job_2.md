My last post discussed, in some broad sense, my experience with getting my first job as a software engineer and being let go from that job. Here, I'd like to offer some thoughts on why I was let go.

I'll start with the fact that economics were not cited as a reason for my departure - the reasons I was let go were, ostensibly, purely performance related. There does exist the possibility that this is the pure truth of the situation, but I've always had a feeling that this is not the case, and there are several reasons why (BTW, if my old bosses are reading this and can plausibly deconfirm any of what I say, feel free to do so).

1. The "fit" for me wasn't good.

On some level, I think they knew that I was not likely to be around much longer. The fact that the other devs were all overseas, of course, meant that opportunities to have direct, 1-on-1 interactions were severely limited. There was also a general sense that no one knew what I should be doing, so I ended up not knowing what exactly to be focusing on (and, more often than not, creating my own work).

I'd like to believe that they did want more US based engineering (or at least that was the hope that was indicated to me when I started), but that costs more money than having overseas engineers, which leads me to...

2. A more general shift in strategy.

I mentioned this in my other post, but around the time I left, the sales department was adding (or attempting to add) many customers. However, the customer support department was very small - when I left, it was three people plus one who had left in the months prior to my exit (in addition, the director of said department made an annoucement on LinkedIn that seemed like they were moving on a few months later).

I know that in the wake of that aforementioned departure, they were trying to find someone to fill that role. I don't know how that ended up going

There was also a partner company who assisted with customer servace as well as installations. Notably, they also saw one of their people (who helped us out a lot in the area where most of our customers were based) leave, so that didn't help.

If the company feels that it needs to focus domestically on customer support, then it's likely that 

But all that

3. More general economic problems

This brings me to my last thought: money.

Like a lot of startups, the company was affected by the Silicon Valley Bank saga, and despite trying to assure us that we wouldn't be majorly affected, it's possible that wasn't completely true.

In addition, the company's main growth strategy was by establishing partnerships with other companies. While this helped keep the company small and allowed it to focus on other things they deemed important, said partnerships were built on high levels of trust - and I saw at least one partnership be made and then go sour - all within about nine months.

A few months before my departure, we found out about what was far and away the biggest of these partnerships. To this day, I'm not fully certain what said partnership (would have) entailed, but it was a MASSIVE company (as in one of the largest in America big).

However, I found out via a LinkedIn post that a data engineer who was working on the other side of said partership was also let go because "the company decided to go in another direction". Obviously, this language is meant to be more general, but as someone who knew a bit more, it made me wonder: "What happened?"

This is all pure speculation, but if one side, for whatever reason, had to change something within the partnership (or, of course, dissolve it completely), that would make my dismissal (as well as them trying to frame it as purely based on my performance). In essence, they needed to cut some spending but didn't want to make the remaining employees suspect that the ship is sinking, so they simply
