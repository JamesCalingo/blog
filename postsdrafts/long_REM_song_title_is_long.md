(Yes, I'm aware that title is sensationalist and clickbait-y, but I'd like to think it's a common mindset right now amongst the people I'd like to "target", if you will, with this post)

Last week, I saw something on Reddit where one of the more notable bootcamp programs had suddenly just shut down. Originally, I was going to write a post on how this was probably a VERY bad sign for the bootcamp industry - an industry many have predicted will see its bubble burst soon.

Turns out the bootcamp as a whole isn't gone - it's just that due to acquisitions/business mergers, they're trying to consolidate operations. The bootcamp in question (HackReactor) had full time and part time tracks, but the part time track is being eliminated in favor of one of the other acquired brands.

So, maybe that was a false alarm. However, it does sorta speak volumes to an issue that has been on a lot of tech peoples' minds recently:

Are bootcamp graduates screwed?

Okay, so maybe "a lot of people" is a bit of a stretch too. However, it's probably something those who are involved in the bootcamp world are thinking about (especially over the past few years).

I've always thought that the most telling sign of bootcamp repudiation would be locking entry level jobs behind the "CS degree or other degree + relevant experience" door (case in point: my first job did this when trying to find a new developer a few months into my tenure). 

Of course, not all Computer Science degrees are created equal. I'm in the Boston area - home of two of the most famous tech institutions in the United States: Harvard and MIT. Having one of those schools on your degree confers a certain level of credibiilty that you won't get from, say,
